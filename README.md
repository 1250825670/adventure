adventure game for cs 344

This assignment is split up into two programs. The first program is contained in a file named "hagenr.buildrooms.c", which when compiled and run creates a series of files that hold descriptions of the in-game rooms and how the rooms are connected.

The second program is called "hagenr.adventure.c" and when compiled run provides an interface for playing the game using the most recently generated rooms.

In the game, the player will begin in the "starting room" and will win the game automatically upon entering the "ending room", which causes the game to exit, displaying the path taken by the player.
